# LinkSheetNightly

If you are using an app such as [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) and like to stay on the bleeding edge of things, this is the repository to use.
Nightlies are built whenever I push (therefore meaning they may contain one or more commits) and are published as Github releases where Obtainium can pick them up.
